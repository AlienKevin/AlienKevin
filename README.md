## Always at the cutting edge: AR/VR/Mobile Development
I am passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technologies like AR/VR and Flutter to create innovative applications. My projects include:
- **[RenovAR Home Renovation App](https://renovar.pages.dev/)**: Created an AR app using Unity and Meta Quest 3's passthrough technology, allowing users to seamlessly visualize and plan interior design by integrating virtual furniture into real spaces. Supported replacing real furniture with virtual ones and rendered real-time outdoor views for enhanced realism.
- **[Cantonese Dictionary Mobile App](https://kevinx.li/projects/wordshk)**: Developed a cross-platform mobile app using Flutter and Rust, supporting efficient search across 15K+ dictionary entries. Optimized user experience with local SQLite and cloud DynamoDB databases. Gained over 5K monthly active users.

## State-of-the-art program synthesis algorithm
My research at the Michigan Intelligent Programming Lab led to a [novel program synthesis algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03705) that outperformed the previous state-of-the-art method for web automation by 6x and solved 2.5x more benchmarks. The algorithm lifts program interpretation from evaluating one program at a time to simultaneously evaluating all programs. I presented this work as the first author at POPL 2024, a top conference in the field, and was invited to give a talk at MIT PLR 2024 as one of 9 distinguished papers.

## Solid foundation in computer systems
I have a strong foundation in computer systems, with experience in operating systems, compilers, and programming languages. My coursework included Programming Languages, Compiler Construction, Intro to Operating Systems, Computer Security, and more. I led a team of 3 to implement a memory manager, concurrent file server, and thread library in C++, and developed comprehensive testing infrastructure to ensure system stability.
